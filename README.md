# Note
This program is *purely* for experiemental and funny purposes, it is not intended to replace the traditional way of installing packages like `pip`.
Althought it is *unconventional* and *mostly useless*, you can still use it to automatically setup packages for when the creator don't upload it to PyPi or they just not have their own setup program.

# Usage
You can run the installer by using 2 methods.
## Command line
- Navigate to where the installer is
- Open up a Powershell or Command Prompt
- Run `python package-installer.py` (`python3 package-installer.py` if you're on Mac or Linux) and enter your package's path.

## Through an editor
Just run it in an editor (like VSCode) and complete the steps similar to using a CMD.
